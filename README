You need autotools to install from git.
Find ready to use packages in /sgoinfre/tjans or on github releases page

Compilation steps:

[*] Configure your project

	Normally you would ./configure and it would work if your ftprintf is
	in your library search path. But it's probably not.
	To fix this, use the set_printf_path.sh script with the location of
	your printf as parameter and the test will be configured.

	You need to compile your libs first before compiling the test.

	If you have libft supplied the library file needs to be in your
	project root OR in the libft subdirectory of your project root
	The configure script will automatically link libft too if needed.

[*] Compile the tests

	Use make. Thats all you need to do.

[*] Run the tests

	After compiling run test_ftprintf
	If you have many errors you can redirect the output to a file
	and conveniently filter it at your own pace.
	On stdout it only outputs the mismatching tests, the output
	of ALL THE TESTS is stored in test_output.txt.

	The test suite runs all tests and if compiled on MacOS it also
	automagically runs a memleak test.

	Error handling is shitty. IF your printf fucks up then the testing
	program will likely segfault on you :)

Good luck.

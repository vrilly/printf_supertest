You need autotools to install from git.
Find ready to use packages in /sgoinfre/tjans or on github releases page

Compilation steps:

[*] Configure your project

	Normally you would ./configure and it would work if your ftprintf is
	in your library search path. But it's probably not.
	To fix this, use the set_printf_path.sh script with the location of
	your printf as parameter and the test will be configured.

	You need to compile your libs first before compiling the test.

	If you have libft supplied the library file needs to be in your
	project root OR in the libft subdirectory of your project root
	The configure script will automatically link libft too if needed.

[*] Compile the tests

	Use make. Thats all you need to do.

[*] Run the tests

	You get 2 binaries, printer_std and printer_ft
	Soon i'll add a full test program
	For now you'll have to execute them both, redirect the output
	to text files and diff them.

Good luck.
